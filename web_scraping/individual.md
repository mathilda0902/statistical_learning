## MongoDB Installation

1. To install MongoDB, use your operating system's package manager:

   - Mac OS X: `brew install mongodb`
   - Ubuntu Linux: `sudo apt-get install mongodb`

2. Much like Postgres, you will need to launch the server before using Mongo for the first time.

   - Mac OS X: `brew services start mongodb`
   - Ubuntu Linux: `sudo /etc/init.d/mongodb start`

3. Check your installation by opening the MongoDB Client:

   - Open a new terminal and type `mongo` to open up a Mongo shell
   - Type `show dbs;` to show the databases you have
   - You can exit by typing `exit`

4. Resources and quick references to Mongo commands:

   - [MongoDB Cheatsheet][mongo-cheatsheet]
   - [Mongo Docs][mongo-docs]
   - [MongoDB Reference Cards][mongo-ref-cards]


## Practicing Mongo Queries

To get familiar with MongoDB, we are going to load in some click-log data from
a government website and do some basic queries on it. Write your queries in a
text file which you will include in your pull request. Paste and run the
queries in the Mongo shell.

1. In your terminal, navigate to the `data` directory in the web-scraping repository and load in the data with
   `mongoimport --db clicks --collection log < click_log.json`

2. In the Mongo shell, run `show dbs;` to make sure the `clicks` database has
   been created. Run `use clicks;` to use the `clicks` database for your
   queries.

3. Inspect the `log` collection in your database. How many entries are in the
   `log` collection?

   If you are not sure about what command to use, you can access the help
   section by:
    - `help`
    - `db.help()`
    - `db.<collection_name>.help()`

   Mongo also has tab complete, so you can tab complete some of your commands
   for convenience.  

4. Print out all of the clicks you have stored using `.find()`. Now using
   `.limit()`, return 10 entries. You can also use `.findOne()` to quickly
   view the first row and examine the available columns.  

5. Use `.find()` to find all the clicks where `cy` (city) is `San Francisco`.
   How many are there?

   db.log.find({'cy': 'San Francisco'})

6. Use `.distinct()` to find all the distinct types of web browsers (under the
   field `a`) people use to visit the sites. Count the the number of distinct web
   browsers (use `.length` on your distinct list).

   db.log.distinct('a').length;

7. Select and count the records where the users have visited a website either
   from a `Mozilla` or an `Opera` web browser. Search the `a` field using
   [regex in mongo][mongo-like-query].

   db.log.find({'a': { $in: [/Mozilla/, /Opera/] }} ).count();

8. Find the type of the `t` (timestamp) field. You can access the type of a
   field in an entry by using `typeof db.log.findOne({'t': {$exists: true}}).t`.
   The field should be a `number` now.

   Convert the timestamp field to the date type. You will need to multiply the
   number by 1000 and then make it a `Date` object (you can create a `Date`
   object by using `new Date()`). You can loop over each record using
   `.forEach()` and then [`.update()`][mongo-update] the record (using the `_id`
   field) with the created `Date` object. When you're done, confirm that the
   data type has been converted. Below is some template code.

   ```javascript
   db.log.find({'t': {$exists: true}}).forEach(function(entry) {
      // your code to update an entry by _id and set the t field as a new
      //  Date() object
   })
   ```

9. Sort the clicks by the timestamp and find when the first click occurred.
   How many clicks occurred in the first hour? To answer this, assign the
   earliest timestamp and timestamp at the one-hour bound to separate variables
   before writing the query.

10. Using Mongo's [aggregation][mongo-aggregation] functionality, can you find
    what the most popular link clicked is? You will need to use `$group`,
    `$sum`, and `$sort`.

## Extra Credit

MongoDB actually has some [geospatial][mongo-geospatial] facilities (don't
worry, PostGreSQL has [even better](http://postgis.net/) ones). Using the
geoindices and Mongo queries, find the following:

1. All clicks within 50 miles of San Francisco
2. All clicks that came from [New England][New-England]

#### CartoDB

[CartoDB](http://cartodb.com/) happens to be one of my favorite tools for
geospatial analysis (with built in PostGIS querying). Map the clicks across
the globe.  Visualize clicks over time with a [torque map][torque-map].

### Additional GUI clients

Here are some additional GUI clients if you so want to try (my favorite is RoboMongo):
- [Robomongo (Multiplatform)](http://robomongo.org/)
- [MongoHub (Mac OSX)](https://github.com/fotonauts/MongoHub-Mac)
   with down-loadable [binary](https://mongohub.s3.amazonaws.com/MongoHub.zip)
- [Humongous (web based)](https://github.com/bagwanpankaj/humongous)
