# Probability
## Objectives:

The following is a short review of the distributions.

```
Discrete:

    - Bernoulli
        * Model one instance of a success or failure trial (p)

    - Binomial
        * Number of successes out of a number of trials (n), each with probability of success (p)

    - Poisson
        * Model the number of events occurring in a fixed interval
        * Events occur at an average rate (lambda) independently of the last event

    - Geometric
        * Sequence of Bernoulli trials until first success (p)


Continuous:

    - Uniform
        * Any of the values in the interval of a to b are equally likely

    - Gaussian
        * Commonly occurring distribution shaped like a bell curve
        * Often comes up because of the Central Limit Theorem (to be discussed later)

    - Exponential
        * Model time between Poisson events
        * Events occur continuously and independently

## functions:

- def covariance(x1, x2)
- def correlation(x1, x2)
- pd.cut
- plot Gausian kde
- scatter plot imposed on linear regression line
- pearson and spearman: correlations
- distribution simulations
- histogram
- np.percentile
