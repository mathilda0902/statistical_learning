# Regularization: Ridge (Shrinkage) and Lasso
## Functions:

1. `mse_ridge` and `mse_lasso`: mean squared error of Ridge / Lasso Regression
2. `plot_ridge`: Plot the parameters (coefficients) of the Ridge regression (y-axis) versus the value of various alpha parameter.
3. `plot_error`: Plot the validation error and training error curves for Ridge regression with different alpha parameters.
4. `plot_lass`: Make a plot of the training error and the validation error as a function of the alpha parameter.
5. `best_choice`: Select a model based on the validation and training error curves.
