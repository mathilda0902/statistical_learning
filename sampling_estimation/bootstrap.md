# Boostrapping Method
## Functions:

- Draw samples of random variables from a specified distribution, dist, with given parameters, params, return these in an array.
- Plot distribtuion of sample means for repeated draws from distribution. Draw samples of specified size from Scipy.stats distribution and calculate the sample mean. Repeat this a specified number of times to build out a sampling distribution of the sample mean. Plot the results.
- Sample standard deviation
- Sample standard error (SE)
- Create a series of bootstrapped samples of an input array.
- Calculate the confidence interval (C.I.) of chosen sample statistic using bootstrap sampling.
- Pearson correlation matrix.
